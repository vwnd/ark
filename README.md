# Inspiration
This project aimed to sympathise with the smaller AEC companies, the start ups and the freelancer. The cost of hosting on CDE Platforms and buying software licenses. We want to use speckle's open source features to create a much cheaper alternative. This is where ark comes in.

# What it does
You are able to drag and drop Rhino and Revit files directly into the website. The Files are automatically converted to speckle objects and you are able to view them on the web app, no software needed. It also automatically prints and displays the drawing sets that are saved in the 3dm and RVT model.

# How we built it
The front-end of the application is developed using TypeScript and the Vue.js framework. The backend has been developed in C#. The application then connects to the native API's to facilitate the management of 3D model from Revit and Rhino respectively.

# Challenges we ran into
Issues with Rhino cloud connections, timescale.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being about to convert 3DM, RVT Models to Speckle, without needing to open native software. Developing an automated Rhino to PDF/ Revit to PDF workflow using headless documentation.

# What we learned
How we can convert RVT files directly in the cloud to Speckle, and the associated costs of doing this compared to the Main CDE Platforms.

# What's next for ark
Adding more file types and developing the UI further. Merging files into versioning history, developing the drawing section UI.
